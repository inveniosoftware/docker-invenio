[![Build Status](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/docker-invenio/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/docker-invenio/actions) [![image](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/inveniosoftware/centos7-python.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/inveniosoftware/centos7-python/) [![image](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/inveniosoftware/centos7-python.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/inveniosoftware/centos7-python/builds/)

This image serves as base image for [Invenio](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio) instances running on CentOS.
The purpose is to provide a base image that is usable in production environments like OpenShift.

The image is based on the official CentOS `centos:7` and `centos:8.2.2004` images and contains:

- Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 set as default Python interpreter with upgraded versions of pip, pipenv, setuptools and wheel.
- Tools: Node.js, NPM, Git, Curl Vim, Emacs, Development Tools.
- Library devel packages: libffi, libxml2, libxslt.
- Working directory for an Invenio instance.
